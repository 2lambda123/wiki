## L-Galaxies

Work has been done to develop [L-Galaxies](http://galformod.mpa-garching.mpg.de/public/LGalaxies) to work with the Caterpillar data. Details of the SAM can be found [here](http://galformod.mpa-garching.mpg.de/public/LGalaxies/Henriques2014a.pdf). The major components can be found [here](http://galformod.mpa-garching.mpg.de/public/LGalaxies/LGalaxies_slides.pdf).

### Accessing the SAM data (in development)

Code has been developed to convert consistent-trees merger trees into a format which L-Galaxies can read. These convereted trees can be found at the following locations for each of the halos.

```bash
/bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/halos/{type}_mass_halos/H{haloid}/H{haloid}_EB_Z127_P7_LN7_LX14_O4_NV4/sam/LGalaxies/treedata/
```

The project is still very much in development so please contact Brendan Griffen if you would like to be involved.
