## Halo Progress

This is updated periodically from `bigbang.mit.edu`. Some runs are on Hydra or Stampede which won't have been updated here unless they have been copied to `bigbang.mit.edu`.

The color code is as follows (and only pertains to the LX14 runs):

* blue: running on Hydra
* yellow: running on Comet
* green: running at Antares
* cyan: running on Odyssey
* red: some level of contamination
* black: nothing of this halo is being run
